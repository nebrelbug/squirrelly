**Summary** 

Squirrelly is a modern, configurable, and blazing fast template engine implemented in JavaScript. It works out of the box with ExpressJS and weighs only **2.5KB gzipped**.

## Why Squirrelly?

### Features:
- Custom helpers
- Custom filters
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Custom delimeters
- Precompilation
- Partials
- Native code
- Writing JavaScript inside the template

## Docs
We know nobody reads through the long and boring documentation in the ReadMe anyway, so head over to the documentation website:

[https://squirrelly.js.org](https://squirrelly.js.org)
## Tests

The default test can be run with `npm test`, and it just checks that compiling and rendering a simple template results in the correct string.
